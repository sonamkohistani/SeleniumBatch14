why we should exclude packages and class from compiling in intellij if we have a syntax error in any of the file in
a project we cant run
another file unless and until we fic that error. some time we want to execute code in some files without fixing
those issue this is where we should exc
How to exclude packages:
Double-click the shift button twice quickly and type excludes and hit enter from the pop-up window click on the plus
button and select the packages that you want to exclude.
How java code is compiled/executed on a computer :
we write the code in file with extension .java
once we hit the run button a software program called compiler checks this code fro errors and convert it to byte code.
usually stored in a folder called bin/out.
JVM another software further converts this code to binary code and this binary code is what is excluded on your computers.
Methods in java:
 Method is a block of code. or some java statement grouped together .
 why we should learn about the methods:
 Methods help us reduce the amount of code that we have to write.for Example if a poece od code is being repeated.
 we can create a method for it and simple call that method
 whenever we need that logic again.
Syntax of creating a method:
 we can create a method inside the class.
 [datatype] [method name] [(datatype variableName)][method body]
 [datatype] can be void boolean string int etc....
 [method name] they are like variable names.
 [(datatype variableName)]used to pass data will calling method

How do we decide that we should use void or a method with a return keyword1:
   if we are building a method that will be used by other parts of your code which required some data from your method
   like an if condition we should not create methods with void type
Example:
  string str="hello";
  int length=str.length();
  if(!str.isEmpty()&&length%2!=0&&length>=3){
  int middleIndex=length/2;
  system.out.println(str.charAt(middleIndex));
